# ML-exploration-tool

This app allows you to test different machine learning algorithms and combinations of hyperparameters to classify passengers from the titanic dataset.

You can create different combination of columns transformation, machine learning algorithms and techniques to get the best precision.

Once you have built your pipeline you can donwload it and reuse it in your project.
